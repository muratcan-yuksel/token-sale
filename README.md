We have our AWToken (Awesome Token), We want to whitelist some accounts, and have a whitelist sale. During the whitelist sale, the token is 1 ETH. After the whitesale ends, standard sale starts, with the token price increasing to 2 ETH.

If a whitelisted user missed the whitesale, they will have to pay the standard price as non-whitelisteds.

The sale ends when the owner decides, or when there are no more tokens to be bought.
